# hello-world
My first repository
Economist and industrial engineer (and soon to be tourism and sustainability graduate) fascinated by new cultures, languages, tech, tourism, video games, and numbers. I enjoy finding the answers in data, optimizing processes, and promoting the beautiful destinations we have around the world. Recently, I also discovered a passion for managing online communities and helping brands connect with their followers. 

After working remotely for 3+ years, I am an advocate of the amazing things that can be achieved by remote teams.

And last but not least, I am also working towards becoming a more sustainable person every day!
